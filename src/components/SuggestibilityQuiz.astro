      Suggestibility Assessment
    </h2>

    <p class="text-subtle mb-6 sm:mb-8 p-4 italic animate-fade-in text-sm">
      This questionnaire helps understand how you take in and interpret
      information. Most questions relate to your teenage years, as these traits
      typically stabilize during adolescence. There are no right or wrong
      answers - simply respond based on your experiences or how you believe you
      would have responded during your teenage years.
