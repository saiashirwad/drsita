			"This cannot be seen as a hospital.. This is a home.. The home of a couple full of goodness, compassion and love in their hearts. They are Dr. Seethalakashmi and Dr.Ramachandran. Their proximity is a healing in itself. We come here for a 15-day long Bachtherapy for the treatment of vaginismus. We have got a new life through it. Dr. Seethalakshmi herself has developed a treatment method here which is 100% successful and effective. It can be said that this is a treatment method that heals both the mind and the body. There is no doubt that it will benefit our lives in one way or another. And the behavior, love, care and dedication of the staff of this hospital are very excellent. I personally felt that the treatment here was a divine blessing and the results were amazing. We will always be indebted to Dr. Seethalakshmi, Dr. Ramachandran and Devikripa Hospital in our lives.",

			"My wife and I recently visited Devikripa Hospital for vaginismus treatment, and we are very much happier with the experience. Dr. Sita and Dr. Ramu Sir are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They truly understand the problems and solutions, leading to the success of our treatment. We stayed at Devikripa Hospital for 14 days, and during this time, our problems were completely resolved. The environment felt like home, with morning yoga sessions conducted by Ramu Sir and group sessions with Dr. Sita, where we could openly discuss any sexual issues. The nurses provided excellent care and were always ready to help. Dr. Sita and Dr. Ramu Sir treated us like their own children, offering exceptional service and mental support. The acupuncture treatment significantly contributed to our success, and the batch therapy was highly effective. The hospital staff created a family-like atmosphere, and Dr. Sita's group sessions were particularly helpful for our happy married life.",

			"We are truly grateful for the care and support we received at Devikripa Hospital during our treatment for vaginismus. Dr. Sita and Dr. Ramachandran were more than just doctors to us—they felt like parents, guiding us with such compassion and understanding every step of the way. Their approach was incredibly comprehensive, and we always felt heard, supported, and cared for. The hospital didn't feel like a hospital at all—it had such a warm, homely atmosphere that instantly put us at ease. Dr. Sita, is one of the kindest and most generous person we've ever met. She's a wonderful listener, which made us feel completely comfortable sharing our concerns. The nurses and staff were equally amazing, always ready to help with a smile. Everyone at Devikripa went above and beyond to ensure our experience was smooth and comforting.",

			"I am more like an introvert kind of a person so to open up like this is an evident change after coming here to Devikripa Hospital. As the name says 'Devikripa', it's because of Devi's kripa only that we were able to identify out problems and came here for consultation. Here we get more homely feel than a hospital and Sita mam and Ramachandran sir make us feel as our parents. We were a batch of 7 couples and all of us were having almost same issues so we were able to open up very easily, share our thoughts, motivate each other. The medicines also is herbal medicines which won't harm our body rather than any artificial syringes and medicines. Here they address our sexual problems as well as our relationship issues our mental and physical well being is also taken care. Today when I am writing this review, the treatment was successful for all the 7 couples.",
