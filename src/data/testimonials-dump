I recently visited this hospital for medical treatment, and we are extremely happy with our experience. Dr. Sita and Dr. Ramu are incredibly knowledgeable and compassionate. They took the time to truly understand my concerns and provided effective treatment for me.

Dr. Sita and Dr. Ramu went above and beyond to offer not only exceptional medical care but also much-needed mental and emotional support. The acupuncture treatment was highly effective.

The hospital staff fostered a warm, family-like environment, making me comfortable. Dr. Sita's sessions were especially impactful, helping me strengthen and ensuring a positive outlook on life. They provided unwavering emotional support, which I deeply appreciated.

I had an exceptional experience at Devikripa Hospital. Dr.Sita Mam, Dr.Ramachandran Sir, and the entire nursing team are highly professional and truly supportive. From the moment we arrived, they made us feel at home. We spent the last 15 days here, and it felt like family. I highly recommend Devikripa Hospital for anyone seeking quality treatment especially in Vaginismus issues. Choosing this hospital was definitely the right decision for us

I recently had the opportunity to experience the vaginismus treatment at Devikripa Hospital, and I am delighted to share my positive experience. The treatment here truly feels like home, thanks to the helping nurses who provide unparalleled care and support.

**Batch Therapy** is a unique approach that greatly contributed to my well-being. Alongside this, the hospital offers various forms of exercise and morning yoga sessions that are invigorating and keep you physically active. The food provided is not only nutritious but also delicious, making the entire stay more comfortable.

The friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere create a positive environment that is vital for healing. The mental support and spiritual guidance offered are incredibly beneficial, providing a holistic approach to health and well-being. Special mention must be made of Dr. Sita and Dr. Ramu Sir, whose expertise and compassionate care are remarkable.

The **acupuncture treatment** played a significant role in my recovery, making the overall experience at Devikripa Hospital highly successful. I highly recommend Vaginismus treatment for anyone seeking comprehensive and compassionate care.

This review is a reflection of the exceptional services and care provided by Devikripa Hospital. They truly understand the importance of a supportive and healing environment. Thank you to everyone at Devikripa for making my treatment a success.
