this is going to be the personal website for Dr Sita, a gynecologist and sexual medicine practitioner based in Kerala, India. She is also a youtuber and has a channel called 'Dr Sita's Mind Body Care'. she has a growing instagram following. her instagram handle is askdrsita. her tagline is "Sexual Health Consultant, Gynecologist, Youtuber, Wellness coach & Educator" but we have some flexibility in that, so if you can come up with something better, that's cool too. 

she's also starting a line of products of her own called "SiRa", where she's going to be selling health products and supplements and that sort of thing, so we're going to eventually need a section on her website for that.

the design should be based on the rose-pine color palette. it needs to look warm, pastely. the background color should be the rose-pine base color. 

we don't need dark/light mode, we just need the default rose-pine color palette.

given the nature of the website, the main colors should be taken from the Rose Pine color palette, (check from global.css)

This palette combines professional medical aesthetics with warm, approachable elements,
perfect for a doctor who bridges traditional medicine with holistic wellness.


the perfect fonts for thie website would be: 'Pier Sans'
